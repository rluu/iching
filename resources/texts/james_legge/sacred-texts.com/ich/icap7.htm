<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">APPENDIX VII</H1>
<P>Treatise on the Hexagrams taken promiscuously, according to the opposition or diversity of their meaning.</P>
<P>This last of the Appendixes is touched on very briefly in the concluding paragraph of the Introduction, <A HREF="icintr03.htm#page_55">p. 55</A>. It is stated there to be in rhyme, and I have endeavoured to give a similar form to the following version of it. The rhymes and length of the lines in the original, however, are very irregular, and I found it impossible to reproduce that irregularity in English.</P>
<P>1, 2. Strength in <I>Kh</I>ien, weakness in Khw&#259;n we find.</P>
<P>8, 7. P&icirc; shows us joy, and Sze the anxious mind.</P>
<P>19, 20. Lin gives, Kw&acirc;n seeks;--such are the several themes</P>
<P>Their different figures were to teach designed.</P>
<P>3. <I>K</I>un manifests itself, yet keeps its place;</P>
<P>4. 'Mid darkness still, to light M&#259;ng sets its face.</P>
<P>51, 52. <I>K</I>&#259;n starts; K&#259;n stops. In Sun and Y&icirc; are seen</P>
<P>41, 42. How fulness and decay their course begin.</P>
<P>26. T&acirc; <I>Kh</I>&ucirc; keeps still, and waits the proper time.</P>
<P>25. W&ucirc; Wang sets forth how evil springs from crime.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_442"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 442</FONT></A></P>
<P>45, 46. Good men in &#381;hui collect; in Shang they rise:</P>
<P>15, 16. <I>Kh</I>ien itself, Y&uuml; others doth despise.</P>
<P>21, 22. Shih Ho takes eating for its theme; and P&icirc;</P>
<P>Takes what is plain, from ornament quite free.</P>
<P>58, 57. Tui shows its scope, but Sun's we do not see.</P>
<P>17, 18. Sui quits the old; K&ucirc; makes a new decree.</P>
<P>23. We see in Po its subject worn away;</P>
<P>24. And F&ucirc; shows its recovering from decay.</P>
<P>35. Above in &#381;in the sun shines clear and bright;</P>
<P>36. But in Ming &Icirc; 'tis hidden from the sight.</P>
<P>48,47. Progress in &#381;ing in Khw&#259;n encounters blight.</P>
<P>31. Effect quick answering cause in Hsien appears;</P>
<P>32. While H&#259;ng denotes continuance for years.</P>
<P>59,60. Hw&acirc;n scatters; but &#381;ieh its code of rules uprears.</P>
<P>40. Relief and ease with <I>K</I>ieh are sure to come;</P>
<P>41. Hard toil and danger have in <I>K</I>ien their home.</P>
<P>38. Khwei looks on others as beyond its care;</P>
<P>37. Ki&acirc; <I>Z</I>&#259;n all includes within its sphere.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_443"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 443</FONT></A></P>
<P>12, 11. While Ph&icirc; and Th&acirc;i their different scopes prefer,</P>
<P>34, 33. T&acirc; <I>K</I>wang stops here as right; withdraws Thun there.</P>
<P>14. T&acirc; Y&ucirc; adhering multitudes can show;</P>
<P>13. Thung <I>Z</I>&#259;n reflects their warm affection's glow.</P>
<P>50, 51. Ting takes what's new; the old is left by Ko.</P>
<P>61, 62. Sincere is <I>K</I>ung F&ucirc;; but exceeds, Hsi&acirc;o Kwo.</P>
<P>55, 56. F&#259;ng tells of trouble; L&uuml; can boast few friends.</P>
<P>30, 29. Fire mounts in L&icirc;; water in Kh&acirc;n descends.</P>
<P>9. Hsi&acirc;o <I>Kh</I>&ucirc; with few 'gainst many foes contends.</P>
<P>10. Movement in L&icirc;, unresting, never ends.</P>
<P>5. Hs&uuml; shows its subject making no advance:</P>
<P>6. In Sung we seek in vain a friendly glance;</P>
<P>28. And T&acirc; Kwo's overthrown with sad mischance.</P>
<P>44. K&acirc;u shows a meeting, where the many strong</P>
<P>Are met by one that's weak, yet struggles long.</P>
<P>53. In <I>K</I>ien we see a bride who will delay</P>
<P>To move until the bridegroom takes his way.</P>
<P>27. Body and mind are nourished right in &Icirc;;</P>
<P>63. All things are well established in K&icirc; &#381;&icirc;.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_444"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 444</FONT></A></P>
<P>54. Kwei Mei reveals how ends the virgin life;</P>
<P>64. Wei &#381;&icirc; how fails the youth (to get a wife).</P>
<P>43. The strong disperse the weak; Kw&acirc;i teaches so.</P>
<P>Prospers the good man's way; to grief all small men go.</P>
